# Differences Between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition

The two major versions of Minecraft are: Bedrock Edition and Java Edition. On the surface they may seem very similar, but under the hood it's a completely different story. Each version's code base creates distinct development environments content creators should be aware of.

In this tutorial you will learn the following:

### Minecraft: Java Edition

This version was originally released in 2009. It was called simply "Minecraft" until it was renamed to "Minecraft: Java Edition" in September 2017. As the name implies, it’s developed in Java and isn’t compatible with the current version of Minecraft for the most part. This edition is commonly referred to as "Java".

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Bedrock Edition was launched on September 20, 2017 and was based on Minecraft: Pocket Edition, which was released in 2011. It brought together nine of the major device platforms under a singular codebase called the Bedrock Engine. This was a rewrite of Minecraft from the ground up and brought along with it some fundamental changes to the platform paving the way for an exciting new development community. This edition is commonly referred to as simply "Bedrock".

## World Format Differences

One major technical difference between both versions is the world format. Bedrock Edition uses the LevelDB format for world storage while Java Edition uses the Anvil format. Due to this, most third-party tools created for Java Edition world editing will not work on Bedrock Edition.

The two versions also use a fairly different block format. Java Edition has flattened its block format using a unique string for each individual block and storing the state of that block separately. Similarly, Bedrock Edition has moved to a string-based system with block states, but have kept some blocks grouped together defined by data value. Basically, this means that blocks are named differently between the versions. In Bedrock Edition, granite would be `stone 1` whereas on Java Edition it's simply `granite`.

## Redstone and Command Differences

The structure and implementation of commands between the two versions have diverged as well. Bedrock Edition's command structure is similar to the system used in versions of Java Edition prior to 1.13. It also forgoes raw JSON strings inside commands for a component-based system. Instead of using long complex JSON strings to customize entities, you can summon an entity with an event to fire, and also name it in a single command.

Redstone functions slightly differently as well. Unlike Java Edition, Bedrock Edition doesn’t support quasi-connectivity. Systems that utilize mechanics such as Block Update Detector (BUD) switches won’t work. Pistons require one tick to retract and won’t leave blocks behind if given a one-tick pulse. Even the way updates happen is slightly different. While the vast majority of redstone circuits work well between the two versions, more complex circuits might not.

### Resource Packs

The idea behind resource packs is the same in both editions: change how the game looks. However, the capabilities and layout are very different.

### Behavior Packs

Bedrock Edition's equivalent to Java's data packs are called behavior packs. Again, both share some similarities and some differences. Only Java Edition can change the shape of blocks, and only Bedrock Edition can change the shape of entities. Each uses a geometry format for this purpose that's incompatible with the other edition. To animate textures, Bedrock uses a single file called `flipbook_textures.json`, while Java uses individual `.mcmeta` files for each texture. Java Edition can create custom fonts and GLSL shaders, while Bedrock cannot. Bedrock Edition can create custom particles and fogs, while Java cannot.

### Gameplay and Player Input

One major difference that tends to be overlooked is the choice of input devices players on different versions prefer. For Java Edition, you can be reasonably sure your player is using a keyboard and mouse; on Bedrock Edition, more than likely your player is using console controls, with touch being a close second, and keyboard and mouse a distant third.

That means when designing experiences in Bedrock Edition, you should be aware of the different types of input players will be using. Also, keep in mind *how* your players are playing. While "spam clicking" might be fine for players using a mouse or even a typical controller, it would provide a poor experience for touch players. Keyboard players with a bow might have perfect aim, but it's a lot more difficult for players using a controller or touch controls. Complex parkour might even be almost unplayable on a mobile device.

### Considerations

Besides known bugs causing issues, advanced features can introduce challenges. Lots of entities with complicated behaviors can slow down some devices. Custom entities that use overly complex models can eat up RAM. Even the number of chunks that can be loaded at once may be dramatically lowered on mobile devices.

## What's Next?

If you are coming here from Java Edition, your first steps in Bedrock Edition will be Add-On development. This will open many doors necessary for content creation on Bedrock.
